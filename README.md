# 🏡 StayBackend: The Airbnb Clone Project Blueprint

## 📖 Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a real-world backend development challenge designed to simulate building a scalable booking platform like Airbnb. It involves working with backend architecture, RESTful and GraphQL APIs, database design, CI/CD integration, and API security — offering hands-on experience in modern full-stack development practices.

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Master collaborative workflows using GitHub
- Deepen understanding of backend architecture and database design
- Implement API-level security best practices
- Learn CI/CD integration for modern software development
- Effectively document and structure a scalable backend project
- Build with Django, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, Docker, and more

## 🗄️ Database Design

The system uses a relational model to define structured, scalable data. Below are the main entities and their relationships:

### 📌 Entities and Key Fields

#### **User**
- `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `is_host`

#### **Property**
- `id`, `title`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `host_id`

#### **Booking**
- `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`

#### **Review**
- `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`

#### **Payment**
- `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`

### 🔄 Entity Relationships

- A **User** can create multiple **Properties** and **Bookings**
- A **Property** belongs to a **User** (host) and can receive **Bookings** and **Reviews**
- A **Booking** is linked to a **User** and a **Property**, and has one **Payment**
- A **Review** is written by a **User** for a **Property**
- A **Payment** is associated with a single **Booking**

## 🧩 Feature Breakdown

### 🔐 User Management
Handles secure user registration, authentication, profile updates, and host/guest roles.

### 🏠 Property Management
Hosts can list, edit, and delete properties; guests can browse available listings by location or price.

### 📅 Booking System
Guests can book available properties, manage check-in/check-out dates, and view booking history.

### 💳 Payment Processing
Securely handles payments using payment gateways and links them to specific bookings.

### ✍️ Review System
Allows guests to leave ratings and reviews for properties after their stay.

### ⚙️ Admin and Optimization Tools
Uses Redis for caching, supports background task processing with Celery, and optimizes database queries.

## 🔐 API Security

### Key Security Measures:
- **Authentication**: Token-based or session authentication to verify user identity.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control for host vs. guest permissions.
- **Rate Limiting**: Throttle requests to prevent abuse (e.g., DDoS protection).
- **Data Validation & Sanitization**: Prevent injection attacks and ensure input integrity.
- **Secure Payments**: Safeguard sensitive data using HTTPS and encrypted tokens.

### Why Security Matters:
- **Protect User Data**: Ensures privacy and trust.
- **Prevent Unauthorized Access**: Enforces access policies.
- **Secure Transactions**: Maintains financial integrity and prevents fraud.

## 🔁 CI/CD Pipeline

### What Is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It automates testing and delivery of code from development to production.

### Why It’s Important:
- **Faster Feedback**: Detect bugs early
- **Stable Releases**: Automatically run tests before deployment
- **Team Productivity**: Eliminates manual deployment steps

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment
- **Docker**: Creates consistent build environments
- **Shell Scripts**: Handles deployment commands and service restarts
